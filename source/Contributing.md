## Contributing to TIMES

Contribution to TIMES is currently done through "Issues" in GitHub which can be used for: 
1) filing bug reports, and 
2) submitting feature and enhancement requests, 

and discussing all the necessary details about them.

In "Issues", you can insert code snippets, links and attachments that demonstrate the issue or describe the proposed enhancement in detail. When a consensus is reached about an issue, the maintainer of TIMES will proceed by implementing the fix or the new feature, and integrate it in the next release of the ETSAP TIMES code. 

Currently the TIMES code is maintained by @Antti-L.

This is the current approach of managing contributions to TIMES, without the need for "pull requests" for the Master branch. For eventual bigger projects a different workflow may be useful in separate branches.
